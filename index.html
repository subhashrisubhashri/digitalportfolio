A computer network is a group of interconnected nodes or computing devices that exchange data and resources with each other. A network connection between these devices can be established using cable or wireless media. Once a connection is established, communication protocols -- such as TCP/IP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- are used to exchange data between the networked devices.

The first example of a computer network was the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. This packet-switched network was created in the late 1960s by ARPA, a U.S. Department of Defense agency.

A computer network can be as small as two laptops connected through an Ethernet cable or as complex as the internet, which is a global system of computer networks.


How does a computer network work?
Devices attached to a computer network use IP addresses that are resolved into hostnames through a domain name system server to communicate with each other over the internet and on other computer networks. A variety of protocols and algorithms are also used to specify the transmission of data among endpoints.
